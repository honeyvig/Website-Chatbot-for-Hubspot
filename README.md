-------------------------
To create a chatbot that can autonomously pull information from your HubSpot content (like blogs, wikis, and articles) and communicate effectively with your customers, we need to combine several technologies. The task requires the use of AI-driven chatbots, web scraping, natural language processing (NLP), and HubSpot integration.

Here’s a Python program that outlines the necessary steps to integrate with HubSpot's content, implement AI models for chat, and support dynamic information retrieval. We will use several tools and libraries such as BeautifulSoup for web scraping, OpenAI's GPT for AI-powered responses, and Flask for creating a web-based chatbot interface.
Key Components:

    Web Scraping (BeautifulSoup): For extracting HubSpot content (blogs, articles, etc.).
    AI Chatbot (ChatGPT): To generate responses based on the scraped content.
    HubSpot API Integration: To interact with the CRM and fetch content.
    Search (Algolia / Azure Cognitive Search): To index and retrieve content dynamically.

Python Libraries:

    beautifulsoup4: For web scraping content from HubSpot pages.
    requests: To fetch content from HubSpot.
    openai: To use GPT models for chatbot responses.
    Flask: To build a simple chatbot web interface.
    dotenv: For securely managing API keys.

Steps:

    Install the necessary libraries:

pip install beautifulsoup4 requests openai flask python-dotenv

Set up the .env file to securely store API keys:

    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    HUBSPOT_API_KEY=your_hubspot_api_key

    Python Code Implementation:

import os
import openai
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()

# Initialize OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')

# HubSpot API endpoint and key
HUBSPOT_API_KEY = os.getenv('HUBSPOT_API_KEY')
HUBSPOT_CONTENT_API = 'https://api.hubspot.com/content/api/v2/blog-posts'


# Function to scrape HubSpot blog content (example: blogs)
def fetch_hubspot_content():
    try:
        # Get list of blog posts (can be adjusted for specific content like wikis, articles, etc.)
        headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {HUBSPOT_API_KEY}'}
        response = requests.get(HUBSPOT_CONTENT_API, headers=headers)
        
        if response.status_code != 200:
            return "Error fetching HubSpot content"

        content = response.json()
        blog_posts = []

        for post in content.get('results', []):
            title = post.get('title', 'No title')
            url = post.get('url', 'No URL')
            blog_posts.append({
                'title': title,
                'url': url
            })

        return blog_posts

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error in fetching content: {e}")
        return "Failed to retrieve content."


# Function to generate a response using OpenAI's GPT (ChatGPT)
def generate_chat_response(user_message, content):
    try:
        # Combine user input with scraped content
        context = f"Content from blog posts: {content}\n\nUser Message: {user_message}"

        # Request ChatGPT to generate a response
        response = openai.Completion.create(
            engine="text-davinci-003",  # or "gpt-3.5-turbo" if using that model
            prompt=context,
            max_tokens=150,
            temperature=0.7
        )
        
        message = response.choices[0].text.strip()
        return message
    
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error in generating response: {e}")
        return "Sorry, I couldn't generate a response at this time."


# Set up the Flask app for the chatbot interface
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/chat", methods=["POST"])
def chat():
    user_message = request.json.get("message")
    
    # Fetch HubSpot content (you can optimize by caching this data or pulling it periodically)
    hubspot_content = fetch_hubspot_content()
    
    # Generate a response based on the user's message and HubSpot content
    if isinstance(hubspot_content, list):
        content_text = "\n".join([f"Title: {post['title']}, URL: {post['url']}" for post in hubspot_content])
    else:
        content_text = hubspot_content
    
    response_message = generate_chat_response(user_message, content_text)
    
    return jsonify({"response": response_message})


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)

Explanation of Code:

    Fetching HubSpot Content:
        We use the HubSpot API to fetch blog posts. You can adjust the API endpoint based on the type of content (articles, wikis, etc.) you want to retrieve.
        The fetch_hubspot_content() function makes an API call to HubSpot and retrieves the list of blog posts, including their titles and URLs. This content is returned in a structured format.

    ChatGPT Integration:
        The function generate_chat_response() sends the user’s input along with the fetched HubSpot content as a context to OpenAI's GPT model (ChatGPT).
        The model generates a response based on the user’s query and the information retrieved from the HubSpot content.

    Flask Web Application:
        A simple Flask app is used to provide an API endpoint (/chat) where users can send a message in the form of JSON ({ "message": "Your query here" }).
        This message is processed, and the chatbot responds with a message fetched from the AI model.

    Web Scraping (Optional) (For HubSpot pages not available via API):
        If HubSpot content is not directly accessible via the HubSpot API, you could use web scraping libraries like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy to scrape content from public pages.

    Response Generation:
        Once the data is fetched, the chatbot generates a response using OpenAI’s GPT model. The fetched content helps the AI provide relevant, context-based answers.

Deploying the Chatbot:

To run the chatbot locally:

    Ensure Flask is running by executing the Python script:

    python app.py

    Your Flask server will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000/, and you can test the chatbot by sending POST requests to /chat.

Sample API Request:

To send a message to the chatbot via a POST request, you can use Postman or cURL.

Example POST request:

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/chat -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message": "What are the benefits of using HubSpot?"}'

Optimizations:

    Caching: Store HubSpot content in a local database or cache system to avoid frequent API calls and improve performance.
    Search Integration: Integrate Algolia or Azure Cognitive Search to index the HubSpot content and allow more sophisticated querying (e.g., full-text search, content ranking).
    Advanced NLP: Enhance AI capabilities by using more advanced NLP models, including custom fine-tuning on your content.

Conclusion:

This Python code creates a simple chatbot capable of autonomously pulling information from HubSpot content (via API), generating responses using ChatGPT, and providing a natural conversational experience. The chatbot can be further optimized for real-time customer interactions by integrating more advanced search and NLP technologies.
